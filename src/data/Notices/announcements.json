    "description": "His research work centred around developing novel refractory high-entropy alloys by blending small amount of silicon (Si). Specific amount of silicon (x=0.25) improved the strength of the alloy without compromising the ductility, and resistance against corrosion. The findings shall be helpful for the application of this Si blended HEA in aerospace and power-plant applications."
